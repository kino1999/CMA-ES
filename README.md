# CMA-ES C++ Implementation

This is a C++ implementation of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm, following the tutorial by Nikolaus Hansen. CMA-ES is an optimization algorithm that is particularly effective for solving non-linear, non-convex continuous optimization problems. This implementation is based on the paper:

CMA-ES is an evolution strategy algorithm for continuous optimization problems. The algorithm works by evolving a population of candidate solutions in a probabilistic manner and adapting its covariance matrix to better explore the solution space.
